# Node.js Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of design patterns used in Node.js applications. Design patterns are proven solutions to common programming problems, and they can help you write more maintainable and scalable code.

## Table of Contents
## Introduction

Node.js is a popular runtime environment for building scalable, high-performance applications. However, as your application grows in complexity, it can become harder to manage and maintain. This is where design patterns come in. By using design patterns, you can create code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

This repository contains examples of various design patterns used in Node.js applications. Each pattern is described in detail, along with code examples that demonstrate how to implement it.

## Patterns

The following design patterns are covered in this repository:

- Singleton pattern
- Factory pattern
- Adapter pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Proxy pattern
- Observer pattern
- Command pattern

Each pattern has its own directory within the repository, containing a README file with a detailed description of the pattern and code examples.

## Contributing
